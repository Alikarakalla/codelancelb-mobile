Γ£û Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating fields in C:\Users\Ali\Desktop\Mobile E-Commerce\codelanclb-mobile\app.json:
 should NOT have additional property 'newArchEnabled'.

Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/

Γ£û Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: react-native-svg
Required by: @hugeicons/react-native
Missing peer dependency: @react-native-picker/picker
Required by: react-native-phone-input
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependencies with "npx expo install react-native-svg @react-native-picker/picker"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without these dependencies. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.
